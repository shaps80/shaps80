### Hey GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I have developed many open-source projects over the years to __inspire ideas__ and __help others__ build better products.

Most recently I created [SwiftUI+](https://github.com/SwiftUI-Plus) a collection of SwiftUI packages that allow you to benefit from newer features all the way back to iOS 13. You can also add the Signed Collection to Xcode 13+ https://benkau.com/packages.json

I spend the majority of my open-source life working on __tools and libraries__ to support these goals.

I also love to __collaborate with others__ and have contributed to many 3rd party open source projects over the past 15 years.

I often __write__ about the things I __love and learn__ at [benkau.com](https://benkau.com)

If you want to __get in touch__, you can follow me on Twitter [@shaps](https://twitter.com/shaps)
