### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have developed many open-source projects over the years to _inspire ideas_ and help others build better products.
I spend the majority of my open-source life working on _tools and libraries_ to support these goals.

I also love to _collaborate_ with others and have contributed to many 3rd party open source projects over the past 15 years.

I often _write_ about the things I _love and learn_ at [https://shaps.me](https://shaps.me)

If you want to _get in touch_, you can follow me on Twitter [@shaps](https://twitter.com/shaps)
