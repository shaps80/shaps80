### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have developed many open-source projects over the years to inspire ideas and help others build better products. I spend the majority of my open-source life working on tools and libraries to support these goals.

I also love to collaborate with others and have contributed to many 3rd party open source projects over the past 15 years.

I often write about the things I love and learn at [https://shaps.me](https://shaps.me)
