### Hey GitHub ðŸ‘‹

I have developed many open-source projects over the years to __inspire ideas__ and __help others__ build better products.
I spend the majority of my open-source life working on __tools and libraries__ to support these goals.

I also love to __collaborate with others__ and have contributed to many 3rd party open source projects over the past 15 years.

I often __write__ about the things I __love and learn__ at [https://benkau.com](https://benkau.com)

If you want to __get in touch__, you can follow me on Twitter [@shaps](https://twitter.com/shaps)
